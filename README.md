<center><h2>Quantitative Methods in Finance Black Scholes Option Pricing CA:</h2></center>
A Jupyter Notebook completed as part of a coursework for my 7CCSMQMF Quantitative Methods in Finance module.
<p>This coursework invovled completing the following three tasks: </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Task 1</b>:
    <p>- Create a CDF() function that takes a single standardised random normal variable, <i>x</i>, and use the polynomial based numerical approximation scheme provided in the specification to compute the cumulative distribution function of x.</p>
    <p>- Use the CDF function over the interval $x \in [-4,4]$ and plot the results.</p>
    <p>- Compare the accuracy of the CDF() function with that of SciPy's norm.cdf() function.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <b>Task 2:</b>
    <p>- Write functions which utilise the Black-Scholes formulae to price the call and puts for both European and Binary style options. The input for the parameter values used by these functions should be entered using the keyboard by the user.</p>
    <p>- Focusing soley on vanilla call and put options (this excludes binary options), change the input values  for each parameter to experiment how they affect option prices. Plots for the impact each of these parameters have on option price is included along with a discussion of the results and their likely meaning. A table which summarises the results is then provided. Note: This task does NOT look at the Greeks.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <b>Task 3:</b>
    <p>- Using the results from the above task, plot the option price <i>V(S)</i> against a varying stock <i>S</i> for some time prior to expiry, <i>t  < T</i>.</p>
      <p>- On the same axis include the payoff function for the corresponding option. Four plots are included as part of this task, one for each European and Binary call and put option.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
